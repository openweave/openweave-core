# Weave Device Layer Design Notes

This document contains overviews, notes and other informative material related to the internal design of the Weave Device Layer.
It is intended as a place to host documentation on topics that are of value to implementers, but for reasons of size or scope don't naturally fit within comments in the code. 

This is intended to be a living document, with an informal structure, that evolves along with the code.  Developers are encouraged
to add things that they think would be useful to their fellow engineers.

/**
 *    @file
 *      The main class defined herein - WeaveServiceManager - defines
 *      an object, generally a singleton, that implements the Weave
 *      Service Directory Profile. This profile allows applications
 *      using Weave to request a connection to a particular Weave
 *      service using a predefined service endpoint. The connect()
 *      call takes callbacks that the service directory sub-layer
 *      invokes when the requested connection is complete or an error
 *      occurs.
 *
 *      The underlying protocol is described in the document:
 *
 *          Nest Weave - Service Directory Protocol
 *
 *      which currently defines two messages:
 *
 *      1) A service endpoint query may be sent by a Weave node when
 *         that node wishes to request directory information from
 *         another node or a service entity. The service endpoint
 *         query message has no fields beyond the Weave exchange
 *         header.
 *
 *      2) A service endpoint response containing directory
 *         information, which shall be sent by a node or service
 *         entity in response to a successful service endpoint query.
 *
 *      In addition to its primary function as a directory lookup
 *      protocol, the Service Directory Protocol supports time
 *      synchronization by allowing the Weave service to optionally
 *      insert time fields in the service endpoint response.

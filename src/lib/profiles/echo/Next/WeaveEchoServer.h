/**
 * @class WeaveEchoServer
 *
 * @brief
 *     Accepts EchoRequest messages from a peer node and responds with an EchoResponse message.
 *
 * The WeaveEchoServer class implements the responder side of the Weave Echo protocol. Similar to
 * the ICMP ping protocol, the Weave Echo protocol can be used to test the liveness and reachability
 * of a Weave node.
 *
 * Applications can use the WeaveEchoServer class to enable automatic response to incoming
 * EchoRequest messages. A corresponding class exists for initiating echo requests (see
 * WeaveEchoClient).
 *
 * By default the WeaveEchoServer responds immediately to an EchoRequest with response containing
 * the same payload as the request.  However this behavior can be altered by the application during
 * processing of the EchoRequestReceived API event.
 *
 * ## API Events
 *
 * During the course of its operation, the WeaveEchoServer object will call up to the application
 * to request specific actions or deliver notifications of important events.  These API event
 * calls are made to the currently configured callback function on the server object.  Except where
 * noted, applications are free to alter the state of the server during an event callback.  One
 * overall exception is the object's Shutdown() method, which may never be called during a callback.
 *
 * The following API events are defined:
 *
 * ### EchoRequestReceived
 *
 * An EchoRequest message was received from a peer.  Arguments to the event contain the request
 * payload, the exchange context over which the message was received and meta-information about
 * the request message.
 *
 * If the application chooses, it may alter the output arguments to the event to force a delay
 * in responding or to suppress the response altogether.  Additionally, it may alter the contents
 * of the payload buffer, which will become the payload for the response message.
 *
 * ### EchoResponseSent
 *
 * An EchoResponse message was sent, or failed to be sent.  Arguments to the event contain the
 * error that resulted from sending the message (if any) and the exchange context over which the
 * message was sent.

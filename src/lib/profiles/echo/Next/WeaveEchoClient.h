/**
 * @class WeaveEchoClient
 *
 * @brief
 *     Provides the ability to send Weave EchoRequest messages to a peer node and receive
 *     the corresponding EchoResponse messages.
 *
 * The WeaveEchoClient class implements the initiator side of the Weave Echo protocol. Similar
 * to the ICMP ping protocol, the Weave Echo protocol can be used to test the liveness and
 * reachability of a Weave node.
 *
 * Applications can use the WeaveEchoClient class to send one-off or repeating EchoRequest
 * messages to a peer node identified by a Binding object.  A corresponding class exists for
 * responding to echo requests (see WeaveEchoServer).
 *
 * ## Client Binding
 *
 * The WeaveEchoClient takes a Weave Binding object which is used to identify and establish
 * communication with the intended recipient of the echo requests.  The Binding can be
 * configured and prepared by the application prior to the initialization of the WeaveEchoClient
 * object, or it can be left unprepared, in which case the WeaveEchoClient will request on-demand
 * preparation of the binding (see Binding::RequestPrepare() for details).
 *
 * On-demand preparation of the Binding will also be requested should it fail after having
 * entered the Ready state.
 *
 * ## SendRepeating Mode
 *
 * The SendRepeating() method can be used to put the WeaveEchoClient into SendRepeating mode.
 * In this mode the client object sends a repeating sequence of EchoRequest messages to the peer
 * at a configured interval.  SendRepeating mode can be canceled by calling the Stop() method.
 *
 * ## Multicast and Broadcast
 *
 * A WeaveEchoClient object can be used to send EchoRequests to multiple recipients simultaneously
 * by configuring the Binding object with an appropriate IPv6 multicast address or IPv4 local
 * network broadcast address (255.255.255.255).  When the WeaveEchoClient object detects a multicast
 * or broadcast peer address, it automatically enters MultiResponse mode upon send of the EchoRequest.
 *
 * In this mode, the object continues to listen for and deliver all incoming EchoResponse messages
 * that arrive on the same exchange.  The object remains in MultiResponse mode until: 1) the
 * application calls Stop() or Send(), 2) in SendRepeating mode, the time comes to send another
 * request, or 3) no response is received and the receive timeout expires.
 *
 * ## API Events
 *
 * During the course of its operation, the WeaveEchoClient object will call up to the application
 * to request specific actions or deliver notifications of important events.  These API event
 * calls are made to the currently configured callback function on the client object.  Except where
 * noted, applications are free to alter the state of the client during an event callback.  One
 * overall exception is the object's Shutdown() method, which may never be called during a callback.
 *
 * The following API events are defined:
 *
 * ### PreparePayload
 *
 * The WeaveEchoClient is about to form an EchoRequest message and is requesting the application
 * to supply a payload.  If an application desires, it may return a new PacketBuffer containing
 * the payload data.  If the application does not handle this event, a EchoRequest with a zero-length
 * payload will be sent automatically.  *The application MAY NOT alter the state of the WeaveEchoClient
 * during this callback.*
 *
 * ### RequestSent
 *
 * An EchoRequest message was sent to the peer.
 *
 * ### ResponseReceived
 *
 * An EchoResponse message was received from the peer.  Arguments to the event contain the response
 * payload and meta-information about the response message.
 *
 * ### CommunicationError
 *
 * An error occurred while forming or sending an EchoRequest, or while waiting for a response.
 * Examples of errors that can occur while waiting for a response are key errors or unexpected close
 * of a connection.  Arguments to the event contain the error reason.
 *
 * ### ResponseTimeout
 *
 * An EchoResponse was not received in the alloted time. The response timeout is controlled by the
 * DefaultResponseTimeout property on the Binding object.
 *
 * ### RequestAborted
 *
 * An in-progress Echo exchange was aborted because a request was made to send another EchoRequest
 * before a response was received to the previous message.  This can arise in SendRepeating mode when
 * the time arrives to send the next EchoRequest.  This can also happen if the application calls
 * Send() after an EchoRequest has been sent but before any response is received.
 *
 * When the object is in MultiResponse mode, the event is suppressed if at least one EchoResponse
 * message has been received.
